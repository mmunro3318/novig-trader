# Markets

> One row per market per day: open interest, volume, OHLC

`markets.csv` has one row per market per day, whether or not the market traded.

On any given day, most markets have no activity and report zeros.
The file is a census of what was listed, not of what moved.

### Which days a market appears

An order-book market appears every day it's listed, traded or not, up to and including the day it settles.
After that it doesn't appear again, because a settled market can no longer change.

A combination appears only on the day it executes.
It trades once and never changes afterward, so republishing it each day would repeat one trade forever.

A combination's `reportTicker` is `COMBO`.
Because it has a single trade, its `open`, `high`, `low`, and `close` are all that one price, and its `openInterest` equals its `dailyVolume`, unless every leg has settled by the end of the day. Then it's `0.00`, like any settled market.

### Columns

**date** `string`

The trading day the row describes, as `YYYY-MM-DD`, from midnight to midnight Eastern.

**marketId** `string`

The market the row describes.
It's the same identifier as `marketId` in `trades.csv`, so you can join the two files on it.

**reportTicker** `string`

The product family the market belongs to: a sport and a market type, like `MLB-SPREAD`.
Every combination reads `COMBO`.
Group by this column to total open interest or volume per product.

**openInterest** `string`

The contracts outstanding at the close of the day, counted across every day the market has traded, not just this one.
A holder with offsetting positions on both sides counts only for the difference, and each contract counts once, not once per side.
A market that has settled by the end of the day reports `0.00`. For an order-book market, that day is its last appearance. A combination appears only on the day it executes, so it reports `0.00` only if it settles that same day.

**dailyVolume** `string`

The contracts traded during this day alone.
A market can have open interest with no volume, which means it traded on an earlier day and those positions are still open.

**open** `string`

The first price traded during the day, in cents to one decimal, from `0.0` to `100.0`.
It's empty if the market didn't trade that day, which isn't the same as trading at zero.
It's never carried forward from an earlier session.

**high** `string`

The highest price traded during the day, in cents.
It's empty on a day with no trades.

**low** `string`

The lowest price traded during the day, in cents.
It's empty on a day with no trades.

**close** `string`

The last price traded during the day, in cents.
It's empty on a day with no trades.

**status** `active | closed | determined | finalized`

`active` accepts orders.
`closed` has stopped trading and awaits a result.
`determined` has a known result that isn't paid out yet.
`finalized` has settled.

> [!NOTE]
>
> `openInterest` and `dailyVolume` are in contracts, where one contract pays \$1, with two decimal places.
> Prices are in cents with one decimal place, because fills don't land on whole-cent ticks: a `close` of `47.5` is a probability of 0.475.
