# Funding

> Move money between your cash wallet and one subaccount, with an idempotency key.

A transfer moves money between your cash wallet and one subaccount.

| Route | Reply |
| - | - |
| `POST /v3/account/subaccounts/{keyId}/transfer` | 202 |
| `GET /v3/account/subaccounts/{keyId}/transfers/{id}` | 200 |

Send a transfer with your `management` key.
Read one with a `management` or `management::read` key.

Both routes spend one token from the `account` [throttle](/api/throttling).

> [!WARNING]
>
> A `202` means we accepted the request, not that the money moved. [Check the transfer's status](#check-the-transfer-status) before you treat the money as moved.

## Send a transfer

| Field | Type | Required |
| - | - | - |
| `direction` | `fund` or `defund` | Yes |
| `amount` | `string` | Yes |
| `clientTransferId` | `string` | No |

* `direction` is named from the subaccount's side: `fund` moves money into it, and `defund` moves money out.
* `amount` is a positive decimal with at most 5 places. We never round it.
* `clientTransferId` is your idempotency key, up to 64 characters and unique per trader. Send one.

**Request**

```json theme={"dark"}
{
  "direction": "fund",
  "amount": "250.00000",
  "clientTransferId": "desk-1-topup-2026-09-09-a"
}
```

**202**

```json theme={"dark"}
{
  "transferId": "c4a71f30-…",
  "status": "Requested",
  "direction": "fund",
  "amount": "250.00000",
  "actualBalance": null,
  "clientTransferId": "desk-1-topup-2026-09-09-a",
  "createdAt": "2026-09-09T14:22:03.118Z",
  "updatedAt": "2026-09-09T14:22:03.118Z"
}
```

## Retry a transfer

What a retry does depends on the `clientTransferId` you send.

| Retry with | Result |
| - | - |
| The same `clientTransferId` | The first request's response, and nothing queued |
| The same ID on another subaccount | 400, because the ID is per trader |
| No ID | A second transfer |

## Check the transfer status

`GET /v3/account/subaccounts/{keyId}/transfers/{id}` returns the transfer. Pass the `transferId` from the `202` as `{id}`.
Its `status` tells you whether the money moved.

| `status` | Means | Final |
| - | - | - |
| `Requested` | Still outstanding | No |
| `Applied` | The money moved | Yes |
| `Rejected` | The money didn't move | Yes |

If a transfer stays `Requested`, contact support. Don't retry it under a new ID.

On a `Rejected` transfer, `actualBalance` holds the balance we found.

## Transfers and transactions

A transfer is your request to move money, and its status.
It covers funding and defunding.

A transaction is one row in your ledger: one movement of the balance.
We write one only when money moves, for fills, fees, maker credits, settlements, and applied transfers.

| `status` | Transfer | Transaction |
| - | - | - |
| `Requested` | Present | Absent |
| `Applied` | Present | `TRANSFER_IN` or `TRANSFER_OUT` |
| `Rejected` | Present, with `actualBalance` | Absent |

Read a transfer with `GET /v3/account/subaccounts/{keyId}/transfers/{id}`.

List transactions with `GET /v3/account/subaccounts/{keyId}/transactions`.

No route lists transfers.
If you lose a `transferId`, send the same request again with the same `clientTransferId` to recover it.
