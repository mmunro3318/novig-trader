# Lifecycle

> Market status transitions, and the two that void your orders.

The `lifecycle` channel reports each change to a market's status.
It costs 1 token per market, and `trades`, `bbo`, and `book` include it.

On an `event:` subject, it also covers markets that open later.

```json snapshot theme={"dark"}
"lifecycle": {
  "seq": 12,
  "status": "OPEN"
}
```

```json delta theme={"dark"}
"lifecycle": {
  "seq": 13,
  "deltas": ["GOLIVE"]
}
```

| Transition | Means | Status after |
| - | - | - |
| `OPEN` | Accepting orders | `OPEN` |
| `CLOSE` | Stopped accepting orders | `CLOSED` |
| `GRADE` | Graded, payouts determined | `SETTLED` |
| `START` | The event started | — |
| `END` | The event ended | — |
| `GOLIVE` | Live | — |
| `UNLIVE` | Left live play | — |

## Live play and your orders

* `GOLIVE` voids every resting order and turns taker fees on.
* `UNLIVE` drains the book again and turns taker fees off.

Taker fees switch on at `GOLIVE` only for a market whose `fee.charged` is `WHEN_LIVE`.
An `ALWAYS` market charges fees in every phase.
See [Trading fees](/api/concepts/fees).

This is one market that goes live twice:

| Phase | What happens |
| - | - |
| Pregame | Orders rest |
| `GOLIVE` | Orders voided, taker fees on |
| In play | Orders rest |
| `UNLIVE` | Book drained, taker fees off |
| `GOLIVE` | Orders voided, taker fees on |

> [!WARNING]
>
> `GOLIVE` and `UNLIVE` repeat on a delay, a review, or a stoppage. Act on each transition as it arrives, and don't assume a fixed number of them.
